   abstract = {This paper presents a fiducial marker system specially appropriated for camera pose estimation in applications such as augmented reality and robot localization. Three main contributions are presented. First, we propose an algorithm for generating configurable marker dictionaries (in size and number of bits) following a criterion to maximize the inter-marker distance and the number of bit transitions. In the process, we derive the maximum theoretical inter-marker distance that dictionaries of square binary markers can have. Second, a method for automatically detecting the markers and correcting possible errors is proposed. Third, a solution to the occlusion problem in augmented reality applications is shown. To that aim, multiple markers are combined with an occlusion mask calculated by color segmentation. The experiments conducted show that our proposal obtains dictionaries with higher inter-marker distances and lower false negative rates than state-of-the-art systems, and provides an effective solution to the occlusion problem. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Selecting a robotic platform for education is an important task, as it can affect the learning process and the respective learning outcome. To effectively select a robotic kit for a specific activity, several factors should be taken into account. However, choosing a robot for one particular application has become more complicated in recent years because of the increased complexity and the available features and facilities constantly introduced into the robots. Despite the fact that several robot selection methodologies have been established for industrial uses, there has been little study on robot selection for learning purposes. The main objective of this work is to determine the most important parameters for selecting a robotic platform, as they were identified through an extensive literature survey. The work aims to assist consumers in choosing the appropriate educational robots, while supporting manufacturers in designing platforms suitable for education purposes.},

In December 2019, COVID-19 began to appear in a few countries. By the beginning of 2020, it had spread to most countries across the world. This is when education challenges began to arise. The COVID-19 crisis led to the closure of thousands of schools and universities all over the world. Such a situation requires reliance on e-learning and robotics education for students to continue their studies to avoid the mingling between people and students. In relation to this alternative learning solution, the present study was conducted. A systematic literature review on educational robotics (ER) keywords between 2015–2020 was carried out for the purpose to review a total of 2253 articles from the selected sources; Scopus (452), Taylor & Francis (311), Science Direct (427), IEEE Xplore (221), and Web of Science (842). This review procedure was labelled as Taxonomy 1. After filtering Taxonomy 1, it was found that 98 scientific articles formed the so-called Taxonomy II that was categorized into six categories: (i) Robotics concepts, (ii) Device, (iii) Robotic applications, (iv) Manufacturing robots, (v) Robotics analysis, and (vi) Education/taxonomy. For this study, only 35 articles in this specific field were selected, of which were then assigned into three categories: (i) Application, (ii) Platform, and (iii) Educational. The results show that the application category carries 17.4%, platform 20%, and education 22.85%. This study serves as the application platform to help students, academics, and researchers.},

At the same time, however, it is helping to create a fast-growing new industry that produces educational robots and tools. Companies with a long tradition, either in the creation of robotic equipment or in the production and distribution of toys, are setting up appropriate divisions and supplying the market with electronic devices for educational robotics. This new market is overgrowing and is rapidly becoming an investment attraction. According to MarketsandMarkets research, the educational robotics market is projected to grow from USD 1.3 billion in 2021 to USD 2.6 billion by 2026. Notably, the educational robotics market is expected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 16.1% from 2021 to 2026. At the same time, however, the field is attracting many startups securing independent funding for equipment design and implementation and independent efforts competing for funding from crowdfunding platforms.

Several articles from the recent literature demonstrate how computer vision has also improved the general educational process. However, still, the number of articles that connect computer vision with educational robotics remains limited. This article aims to present a systematic mapping review, with three research questions, investigating the current status of educational robotics, focusing on the synergies and interdependencies with the field of computer vision. The systematic review outlines the research questions, presents the literature synthesis, and discusses findings across themes. More precisely, this study attempts to answer key questions related to the role, effectiveness and applicability of computer vision in educational robotics. After a detailed analysis, this paper focuses on a set of key articles. It analyzes the research methodology, the effectiveness and applicability of computer vision, the robot platform used, the related cost, the education level, and the educational area explored. Finally, the results observed are referred to as educational process benefits. The reviewed articles suggest that computer vision contributes to educational robotics learning outcomes enhancing the learning procedure.

Although previous research has highlighted potentials of applying educational robotics in STEM education, there is a lack of empirical evidence to investigate and understand the overall effects of using educational robotics in STEM education as well as the critical factors that influence the effects. To fill this gap, this research conducted a multilevel meta-analysis to examine the overall effect size of using educational robotics in STEM education under K-16 education based on 30 effect sizes from 21 studies published between 2010 and 2022. Furthermore, we examined the possible moderator variables of robot-assisted STEM education, including discipline, educational level, instructor support, instructional strategy, interactive type, intervention duration, robotic type, and control group condition. Results showed that educational robotics had the moderate-sized effects on students’ STEM learning compared to the non-robotics condition. Specifically, educational robotics had moderate-sized effects on students’ learning performances and learning attitudes, and insignificant effects on the improvement of computational thinking. Furthermore, we examined the influence of moderator variables in robot-assisted STEM education. Results indicated that the moderator variable of discipline was significantly associated with the effects of educational robotics on STEM learning. Based on the findings, educational and technological implications were provided to guide future research and practice in the application of educational robotics in STEM education.},

The contribution of the paper is fourfold. First, future readers can use this paper as a reference point for exploring the expected learning outcomes of educational robotics. From an exhaustive list of potential learning gains, we propose a set of six learning outcomes that can offer a starting point for a viable model for the design of robotic activities. Second, the paper aims to serve as a survey for the most recent ER platforms. Driven by the growing number of available robotics platforms, we have gathered the most recent ER kits. We also propose a new way to categorize the platforms, free from their manufacturers' vague age boundaries. The proposed categories, including No Code, Basic Code, and Advanced Code, are derived from the prior knowledge and the programming skills that a student needs to use them efficiently. Third, as the number of ER competitions, and tournaments increases in parallel with ER platforms' increase, the paper presents and analyses the most popular robotic events. Robotics competitions encourage participants to develop and showcase their skills while promoting specific learning outcomes. The paper aims to provide an overview of those structures and discuss their efficacy. Finally, the paper explores the educational aspects of the presented ER competitions and their correlation with the six proposed learning outcomes. This raises the question of which primary features compose a competition and achieve its' pedagogical goals. This paper is the first study that correlates potential learning gains with ER competitions to the best of our knowledge.},

   abstract = {Robotics provides an increasing number of solutions for real-life problems, from autonomous driving to automatic cleaning, inspection and logistics. The demand of robotics education to train future engineers is also growing, both in regular degrees at universities and also in massive open online courses (MOOCs). Beyond theory lectures, robotics education typically requires hands-on and practiced robot programming to be effective and let the student develop the desired skills. This paper presents Unibotics, an open online learning platform that allows editing and running robot programs from the browser, and provides more than 20 academic units on service robotics, autonomous driving, drones, and mobile robotics. It uses state-of-the art open source robot simulator (Gazebo) and robot middleware (ROS), and so it is extensible with new exercises. It is intended as a tool for practical learning in robotics engineering university courses. The platform has been used by 130 students from four different university degrees. Furthermore, it has been experimentally validated at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (URJC) Master Degree in Computer Vision with 22 students.},

@article{Fabregas2016,
   abstract = {? 2015 Springer Science+Business Media DordrechtThis paper describes the development of a motivating and innovative multi-robot formation control platform for laboratory experiments with mobile robots. The platform is composed of two components: a simulator and an environment to experiment with low cost wheeled mobile robots. The environment constitutes a ready to use test tool that provides to engineering students the opportunity to simulate and test many different formation and cooperation control strategies with a real system. Currently the platform is used in the Systems and Control Engineering Master program offered by the National University of Distance Education (UNED) and the Complutense University of Madrid (UCM) in Spain. The use of the platform exposes students to hands-on laboratory sessions, contributing to their development as engineers.},

   abstract = {Educational robotics can play a key role in addressing some of the challenges faced by higher education in Africa. One of the major obstacles preventing a wider adoption of initiatives involving educational robotics in this part of the world is lack of robots that would be affordable by African institutions. In this paper, we present a survey and analysis of currently available affordable mobile robots and their suitability for teaching computer science at African universities. To this end, we propose a set of assessment criteria and review a number of platforms costing an order of magnitude less than the existing popular educational robots. Our analysis identifies suitable candidates offering contrasting features and benefits. We also discuss potential issues and promising directions which can be considered by both educators in Africa but also designers and manufacturers of future robot platforms.},
